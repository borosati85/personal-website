# Personal Website

## Description
This is a personal website I made for showing my past projects while I was looking for a developer job.

In this application I used the following technologies:
- React
- Styled Components
- Email.js
- GSAP

## Installation
You can simply clone this repository, and run "npm install" to install dependencies, then use "npm start" to start the application.
