            I'm a self taught web developer, I believe in life long learning and
            continous improvement, that's why I started learing to code a few
            years ago. I enjoy solving complex problems by breaking it down into
            smaller parts, and solving them one by one. I love creating things
            on the web, be it a website, a webshop, an app, or anything, I
            always give my 100% in it. I like facing challenges, I think that is
            what makes us better in the long run. A challenge today will be a
            routine task tomorrow. I can, and I like work alone, but I can be a
            part of any team. I have my own ideas, but I'm always respect
            others, and always open to discussions. My goal is the create the
            best product possible.{" "}
